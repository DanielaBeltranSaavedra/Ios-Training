<h1> Exercise TedTalks </h1>

You should hace been provided a json file with TED talk metadata. The dataset includes thigs like names, descriptions, dates and so forth. Build us a small app that uses this data set in some way. The choice of how you use this data and how your app functions is entirely yours.
<h2>The Guidelines</h2>

* It doesn'thace to be pretty (from a UI/UX perspective)
* It must be functional, as in it needs to actually do something. No pseeudo code, no stubs.
* Please include some tests that demonstrate you care :)

<h2>What we are looking for</h2>

* Technical understanding and proficiency in the language you are coding in.
* Understanding the ecosystem tou are working within.
* Creative ( We love maps, searching, filtering and generally useful applications of data to name but few examples)
* Efficiency
* Execution

<h2>Things to consider</h2>

* The app should load/parse the json file only ONCE when is starting
* There should be no JANK in the app UI, especially for lists
* To apply filters you can implement the delegates for pickerView
* Filters are: event, main speaker, title, name, description

<h2>MVVM modification</h2>

1. Two buttons will be added in the bottom of screen (previous and next). With them you will be able to navigate between tedtalks withouth the need to go back and select a new one.
